Better OnePlus Pad Pro magnet keyboard key layout

-------

Created with https://github.com/ris58h/exkeymo-web

Tried my best to keep all functions original.

Modifications:

ESC is now ESC
Search key is now FN
AI/Meta key is now Back, works as Meta key in Moonlight
Brightness to Del are mapped to F1-F12 when pressing Search(FN), except lock screen button cannot be blocked.

In Moonlight all modifications are working as intended.

This is a non-root solution so it won't work in apps that handles the replacing keys or listens to all keycode like browsers, but you probably won't need these buttons in a browser.

Note: The touchpad disabling mechanism seems to be implemented on-keyboard, thus here's no way to pervent touchpad being disabled when pressed that key. So if you pressed FN+TouchPadDisable for F4, the touchpad will be disabled. Simply press the button again whtiout FN will take the touchpad back.
