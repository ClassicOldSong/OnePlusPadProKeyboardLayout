Better OnePlus Pad Pro magnet keyboard key layout

-------

Tried my best to keep all functions original.

Modifications:

ESC is now ESC
Search key is now FN
AI/Meta key is now Back, works as Meta key in Moonlight
Brightness to Del are mapped to F1-F12 when pressing Search(FN), except lock screen button cannot be blocked.

In Moonlight all modifications are working as intended.

This is a non-root solution so it won't work in apps that handles the replacing keys or listens to all keycode like browsers, but you probably won't need these buttons in a browser.

Enjoy your keyboard!
